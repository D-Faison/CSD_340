            <p class="intro">
                Hi I am DeJanae; I go by DJ or Deja(like DeJa Vu). I prefer those two
                rather than my full name. I was born in Michigan but spent 
                99% of my life in New Jersey. I have a LOT of hobbies, like 3D design,
                crochet, knitting, game design etc. 
            </p>

            <p>
                For my 3D art I use <span class="sentence" style="color: orange; font-weight: bold"> Blender</span>
                to model enviroments, food and characters. To color the model, some use external programs 
                like Adobe Substance painter but for personal products Blender offers a texture 
                painting space that i feel works just as good. I often do small animations, like 
                turntable loops, blinking/breathing and particle effects. Which I enjoy since,
                modeling, weight painting, UV editing, and making the bones and animations can be a lot.
            </p>

            <p>
                I hope to add my 3D art into future projects i have like in my web design, software design, and game design.
                My family likes going to the casino often so the machincs behind slot machines really interest me. From the pretty
                graphics to the math behind how the grand prize rises and so on. So a goal of mine would to have my design and code
                being used in such a light playful mannor.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have been crocheting and knitting for years. It is not a hobby I can say 
                "I want to make money off of it but they make great presents". <span class="sentence">I crochet primarily
                stuffed animals; though i can do scarves, blankets and other things but I enjoy doing
                stuffed animals the most</span>.I can only knit scarves so far but I hope to learn how to knit
                stuffed animals soon as well. Some people confuse the two often. Crochet has <span class="sentence" style="font-weight: bolder">one</span> 'stick';
                multiple different stitches. Knitting uses <span class="sentence" style="font-weight: bolder">two</span> sticks and has two stitches.
