            <p>
                Hi I am DeJanae; I go by DJ or Deja(like DeJa Vu). I prefer those two
                rather than my full name. I was born in Michigan but spent 
                99% of my life in New Jersey. I have a LOT of hobbies, like 3D design,
                crochet, knitting, game design etc. 
            </p>

            <p>
                For my 3D art I use <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold"> Blender</span>
                to model enviroments, food and characters. To color the model, some use external programs 
                like Adobe Substance painter but for personal products Blender offers a texture 
                painting space that i feel works just as good. I often do small animations, like 
                turntable loops, blinking/breathing and particle effects. Which I enjoy since,
                modeling, weight painting, UV editing, and making the bones and animations can be a lot.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have been crocheting and knitting for years. It is not a hobby I can say 
                "I want to make money off of but  "
